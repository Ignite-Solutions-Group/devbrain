# DevBrain

An Azure-native remote MCP server — built on Azure Functions and Cosmos DB — that gives any AI tool persistent, shared access to developer knowledge. One brain, zero upload tax, for teams already living in the Microsoft Azure dev ecosystem.

## The Problem

Every AI tool starts from zero. You paste the same sprint doc into Claude, copy architecture notes into Copilot, re-explain project state to Cursor. Each tool is an island. Your knowledge lives in scattered markdown files, and every conversation begins with a 6,000-character upload ritual.

DevBrain eliminates this. Deploy once, point any MCP client at the endpoint, and every AI tool you use shares the same persistent knowledge store.

## Why DevBrain over alternatives

**One instance. Every project. Any AI tool.**

Deploy DevBrain once and every project you work on shares the same knowledge store. Load context from multiple projects in a single session — no workspace switching, no separate deployments, no file uploads.

```
# Morning session — three projects, three tool calls
GetDocument(key="state/current", project="acme-platform")
GetDocument(key="state/current", project="devbrain")
GetDocument(key="state/current", project="client-abc")
```

Compare that to alternatives:

- **Serena** — per-repo MCP server, requires workspace switching between projects
- **Claude Project Knowledge** — manual file uploads, single project scope, resets between sessions
- **Local markdown files** — not shared across AI tools, no persistence

DevBrain is the only approach that gives every AI tool (Claude, Copilot, Codex, Cursor) shared persistent access across all your projects from a single deployed endpoint.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription
- [Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)

## Deploy in 5 Minutes

```powershell
azd init -t Ignite-Solutions-Group/devbrain
azd up
```

After deployment, retrieve your MCP extension system key from the Azure Portal (**Function App > App keys > System keys > `mcp_extension`**) and use it in your client configuration below.

## First Run

After a fresh `azd up`, seed the default reference documents so any AI tool connecting to your new instance immediately has usage guidance available:

```powershell
$env:DEVBRAIN_KEY = '<YOUR_FUNCTION_KEY>'
./scripts/seed-devbrain.ps1
```

The script reads the Function App URL from the active azd environment (`AZURE_FUNCTION_URL`) and the MCP key from `$env:DEVBRAIN_KEY`, prompting for either if not set. It calls the DevBrain MCP endpoint directly and upserts a baseline set of documents (currently `ref/devbrain-usage` in the `default` project). Re-running is safe — every upsert is a full overwrite. Source content for the seed lives under [`docs/seed/`](docs/seed/).

## Configure Your MCP Client

Authentication uses the Azure Functions MCP extension system key, passed via the `x-functions-key` header. See [Authentication](#authentication) for details.

### Claude Code CLI (`.claude/mcp.json`)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "devbrain": {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "https://<FUNCTION_URL>/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse",
      "headers": {
        "x-functions-key": "<YOUR_FUNCTION_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`)

Claude Desktop doesn't support remote MCP auth natively, so use [`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) as a stdio-to-SSE proxy:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "devbrain": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://<FUNCTION_URL>/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse",
        "--header",
        "x-functions-key:${DEVBRAIN_KEY}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DEVBRAIN_KEY": "<YOUR_FUNCTION_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code / GitHub Copilot (`.vscode/mcp.json`)

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "devbrain": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://<FUNCTION_URL>/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse",
      "headers": {
        "x-functions-key": "<YOUR_FUNCTION_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Add via Cursor's MCP settings with the same URL and `x-functions-key` header.

## Session Startup / AGENTS.md

DevBrain is only as useful as the context your AI tools actually load. The recommended pattern is a small `AGENTS.md` file at the repo root that tells any AI tool how to pull context from DevBrain at the start of a session.

**Why AGENTS.md:** GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Codex all read `AGENTS.md`. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` but can `@import` other files — so a one-line `@AGENTS.md` in `CLAUDE.md` keeps a single source of truth across every tool.

### `AGENTS.md`

```markdown
## DevBrain Session Startup

At the start of every session, load project context from DevBrain:

1. GetDocument(key="state/current", project="{your-project}")
2. If a sprint is active: GetDocument(key="sprint/{sprint-name}", project="{your-project}")

Before ending a session, write back any significant changes:
- UpsertDocument key="state/current" if project state changed
- UpsertDocument key="sprint/{name}" if sprint progress changed

DevBrain is the canonical source of truth. Do not ask the user to upload
files or paste context — read it directly from DevBrain.
```

### `CLAUDE.md`

```markdown
@AGENTS.md
```

New to a project? See [docs/project-init.md](docs/project-init.md) for the recommended first documents to seed.

## Tools Reference

All tools accept an optional `project` parameter (defaults to `"default"`) to isolate documents by project.

| Tool | Inputs | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `UpsertDocument` | `key` (required), `content` (required), `tags`, `project` | Create or replace a document by key |
| `GetDocument` | `key` (required), `project` | Retrieve a document by key |
| `ListDocuments` | `prefix`, `project` | List document keys, optionally filtered by prefix |
| `SearchDocuments` | `query` (required), `project` | Substring search across keys and content |

## Key Conventions

Documents are organized by key prefix. These conventions are recommended but not enforced:

| Prefix | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `sprint/{name}` | Sprint specs, e.g. `sprint/license-sync` |
| `state/current` | Current project state document |
| `arch/{name}` | Architecture docs |
| `decision/{name}` | Architecture decision records |
| `ref/{name}` | Reference material, infra constants |

## Local Development

1. Install prerequisites: .NET 10 SDK, [Azure Functions Core Tools v4](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local), Azure CLI.

2. Log in to Azure (for Cosmos access via `DefaultAzureCredential`):
   ```powershell
   az login
   ```

3. Copy and configure local settings:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item src/DevBrain.Functions/local.settings.json.example src/DevBrain.Functions/local.settings.json
   # Edit with your Cosmos DB account endpoint
   ```

4. Run:
   ```powershell
   cd src/DevBrain.Functions
   func start
   ```

## Authentication

DevBrain uses the Azure Functions MCP extension system key (`x-functions-key` header) for authentication. Easy Auth (Entra ID OAuth) was disabled due to upstream OAuth compatibility issues with MCP clients (see below).

The system key is auto-generated by the MCP extension and can be retrieved from the Azure Portal under **Function App > App keys > System keys > `mcp_extension`**.

## Known Limitations

### Microsoft Entra ID + MCP OAuth — ecosystem-wide incompatibility

DevBrain was originally designed to use Entra ID Easy Auth for OAuth-based clients. Two Entra enforcement issues block all web-based MCP clients:

1. **`AADSTS9010010` — `resource` parameter rejected.** Since March 2026, Entra's v2 endpoint rejects OAuth requests that include both `scope` and `resource` parameters. Multiple MCP clients send `resource` by default (Claude, GitHub Copilot CLI). This is not client-specific — it affects any MCP client hitting an Entra-protected endpoint.

2. **Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) not supported.** Web-based MCP clients (Claude web/mobile, ChatGPT) require DCR to initiate OAuth flows. Entra ID does not support DCR. There is no server-side workaround.

These are upstream issues between Entra and the MCP OAuth spec. Easy Auth was disabled in favor of function key auth to unblock header-capable clients.

**Status:** Blocked — requires changes in Microsoft Entra ID, MCP client OAuth implementations, or both.

### Client compatibility

| Client | Auth | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| Claude Code CLI (Windows) | `x-functions-key` header | Working |
| Claude Desktop (Windows) | `x-functions-key` via `mcp-remote` proxy | Working (with workaround) |
| VS Code / GitHub Copilot (Windows) | `x-functions-key` header | Working |
| Codex App (Windows) | `x-functions-key` header | Working |
| Cursor | `x-functions-key` header | Expected to work (not tested) |
| Claude Web / Mobile | OAuth (DCR + `resource` param) | Blocked — both issues |
| ChatGPT | OAuth (DCR required) | Blocked — DCR not supported |
| GitHub Copilot Chat (web) | OAuth | Blocked |
